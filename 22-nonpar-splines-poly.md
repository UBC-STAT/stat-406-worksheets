# Non-parametric regression

We now turn our attention to the situation where the 
regression function E(Y|X) is not necessarily linear.
Furthermore, we will assume that its *form* is
**unknown**. If we knew that the regression
function was a linear combination
of a sine and a cosine function, "E(Y|X=x) = a + b sin(x)
+ c cos(x)", where *a*, *b* and *c* are uknown, 
for example, then the problem would in fact be a linear
regression problem. More in general, 
when the true regression function is known (or
assumed) to belong to a family of functions that we can parametrize, then
the estimation can be done via standard least squares.
Instead here we focus on the case where the
regression function is **completely unknown**.

In this note and the next one will discuss two ways to estimating
$E(Y|X)$: 

(a) one using bases (e.g. a polynomial basis, or a spline basis); and 
(b) one using kernels (aka local regression).

To simplify the presentation (but also because of
an intrinsic limitation of these methods, which will
be discussed in more detail later in the course), we will initially only consider
the case where there is a single explanatory variable
(i.e. X above is a scalar, not a vector). 

## Polynomial regression

To illustrate these basis methods, we will consider the 
`lidar` data, available in the package `SemiPar`. More
information is available from the
corresponding help page: `help(lidar, package='SemiPar')`. 
We now load the data and plot it, the response
variable is `logratio` and the explanatory one is
`range`:


```r
data(lidar, package = "SemiPar")
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
```

In class we discussed the formal motivation to look into
a polynomial approximation of the regression function. 
This argument, however, does not specify which degree
of the approximating polynomial to use. Here we 
first try a 4th degree polynomial and the problem reduces to a linear
regression one (see the lecture slides). We can use a 
command like `lm(logratio ~ range + range^2 + range^3 + range^4)`.
However, this call to `lm`  will not work as we intend it 
(I recommend that you check this and find out the reason why). 
Instead, we would need to use something like
`lm(logratio ~ range + I(range^2) + I(range^3) + I(range^4))`. 
To avoid having to type a long formula, we can instead use
the function `poly()` in `R` to generate the design matrix 
containing the desired powers
of `range`, and plug that into the call to `lm()`. 
The code below fits two such approximations (a 3rd degree and a 
4th degree polynomial), plots the data
and overlays the estimated regression function:


```r
# Degree 4 polynomials
pm <- lm(logratio ~ poly(range, 4), data = lidar)
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
lines(predict(pm)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "blue")
pm3 <- lm(logratio ~ poly(range, 3), data = lidar)
lines(predict(pm3)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "hotpink")
legend("topright", legend = c("3rd degree", "4th degree"), lwd = 6, col = c("hotpink", "blue"))
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/poly4-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that this fit is reasonable, although there is probably 
room for improvement. Based on the 
formal motivation discussed in class to use polynomials in the first 
place, it may seem natural to increase the order
of the approximating polynomial in order to improve the quality 
of the approximation. However, this is
easily seen not to be a good idea. Below we compare the 
4th degree approximation used above (in blue) with
a 10th degree one (in red): 


```r
# Degree 10 polynomials
pm2 <- lm(logratio ~ poly(range, 10), data = lidar)
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
lines(predict(pm)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "blue")
lines(predict(pm2)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "red")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/poly10-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that the 10th order fit follows the data much more closely, but
it starts to become "too adaptive" and departing quite often from the
main (larger scale) trend we associate with the regression (conditional 
mean) function. 

(Can you explain the discrepancy between what we observe above and
the motivation we used in class, that suggests that higher order 
polynomials provide better approximations?)

## A more stable basis: splines

Part of the problem with global polynomial bases as the ones used 
above is that they necessarily become more wiggly within the range of the data, and also quickly 
increase or decrease near the edge of the observations. A more stable
but also remarkably flexible basis is given by spline functions, 
as discussed in class. 

We first here show how to build a naive linear spline basis with 
5 knots (placed at the `(1:5)/6` quantiles 
(i.e. the 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83 percentiles) of the
observed values of the explanatory variable), and use
it to estimate the regression function. 
Remember that a linear spline function with knot *w* is
given by `f_w(x) = max( x - w, 0 )`. Given a fixed 
set of pre-selected knots *w_1*, *w_2*, ..., *w_k*, 
we consider regression functions that are linear combinations 
of the corresponding k linear spline functions. 

Note that for higher-order splines (e.g. cubic splines
discussed below), the naive spline basis used above is numerically 
very unstable, and usually works poorly in practice. 
I include it here simply as an illustration of the
methodology and to stress the point that this type of approach 
(that estimates the regression function as a linear combination
of an explicit basis) is in fact nothing
more than slightly more complex linear models. 

First we find the 5 knots mentioned above that will be used to 
construct the spline basis: 

```r
# select the knots at 5 specific quantiles
(kn <- as.numeric(quantile(lidar$range, (1:5) / 6)))
#> [1] 444.6667 499.6667 555.0000 609.6667 664.6667
```
Now we compute the matrix of "explanatory variables", that
is: the matrix that in its columns has each of the 5 basis 
functions *f_1*, *f_2*, ..., *f_5* evaluated 
at the n observed values of the (single) explanatory variable *x_1*, ..., *x_n*. In other words, the
matrix **X** has in its *(i, j)* cell the value *f_j(x_i)*, 
for *j=1*, ..., *k*, and *i=1*, ..., *n*. In the code below we use (abuse?) `R`'s *recycling* rules 
when operating over vectors and arrays (can you spot it?)

```r
# prepare the matrix of covariates / explanatory variables
x <- matrix(0, dim(lidar)[1], length(kn) + 1)
for (j in 1:length(kn)) {
    x[, j] <- pmax(lidar$range - kn[j], 0)
}
x[, length(kn) + 1] <- lidar$range
```
Now that we have the matrix of our "explanatory variables", we can simply use `lm` to estimate 
the coefficients of the linear combination of the functions in the spline basis 
that will provide our regression function estimator. We then plot the data and overlay the 
fitted / estimated regression function: 


```r
# Fit the regression model
ppm <- lm(lidar$logratio ~ x)
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
lines(predict(ppm)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "hotpink")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/splines1-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

There are better (numerically more stable) bases for the same linear 
space spanned by these spline functions. These bases have different 
numerical properties and can become cumbersome to describe. Here we
use the function `bs` (in package `splines`) to build a B-spline basis. 
For an accessible discussion, see for example [@wood2017generalized, Section 4.1].

Given the chosen knots and the degree of the splines
(linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.) the set (linear space) 
of functions we are using to construct our regression estimate
does not depend on the specific basis we use
(in other words: these are different bases that span
the same linear space of functions). As a consequence,
the estimated regression function should be the same regardless of the basis we use 
(provided we do not run into serious numerical issues
with our naive basis). To illustrate this fact, 
we will use a B-spline basis with the same 5 knots as above, 
and compare the estimated regression 
function with the one we obtained above 
using our **poor people naive basis**. The plot below overlays both
fits (the naive one with a thick pink line as above, and the one
using b-splines with a thinner blue line):


```r
library(splines)
ppm2 <- lm(logratio ~ bs(range, degree = 1, knots = kn), data = lidar)
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
lines(predict(ppm)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 8, col = "hotpink")
lines(predict(ppm2)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 3, col = "darkblue")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/bsplines1-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

As expected, both fits provide the same estimated regression function, although
its coefficients are naturally different (**but their lengths are the same**, 
is this a coincidence, or will it always happen?)

```r
as.vector(coef(ppm))
#> [1]  0.0269095640  0.0002488169 -0.0003235802 -0.0082773735  0.0063779378
#> [6]  0.0007385513 -0.0001847752
as.vector(coef(ppm2))
#> [1] -0.04515276 -0.01010104 -0.00657875 -0.02093988 -0.48762440 -0.60636798
#> [7] -0.68496471
```
Note that, because we are 
using a set of linear splines, our estimated regression functions will always be piecewise 
linear (i.e. linear functions between each pair of knots). To obtain smoother (e.g. differentiable, 
continuously differentiable, or even twice continously differentiable) 
regression estimators below we will use higher-order splines. 

## Higher order splines (quadratic, cubic, etc.)

In what follows (as above) we will use the function `bs` to evaluate the desired
spline basis on the observed values of the explanatory variable (in this case `range`).

We use the arguments `degree = 2` and `knots = kn` to indicate we want a 
quadratic spline basis with knots located at the elements of the vector `kn`. 
As before, we then simply use `lm` 
to estimate the coefficients, and overlay the estimated regression 
function over the data: 


```r
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
ppmq <- lm(logratio ~ bs(range, degree = 2, knots = kn), data = lidar)
lines(predict(ppmq)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "steelblue")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/bsplines2-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

A useful consequence of the fact that these regression estimators are in fact 
just linear regression estimators
(but using a richer / more flexible basis than just the straight
predictors) is that we can easily compute (pointwise) standard errors
for the fitted regression curve, as follows. We first fit and 
plot a quadratic 
spline using the same 5 knots as before:

```r
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
ppmc <- lm(logratio ~ bs(range, degree = 2, knots = kn), data = lidar)
lines(predict(ppmc)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "gray30")
```
To compute the estimated standard error of the predicted regression curve on a grid
of values of the explanatory variable `range`, we first build a grid of 200 equally spaced points 
within the observed scope of the variable `range`:

```r
xx <- seq(min(lidar$range), max(lidar$range), length = 200)
```
The  `predict` method for objects of class `lm` returns estimated standard
errors for each fitted value if we set the argument
`se.fit = TRUE`:

```r
ppmc <- lm(logratio ~ bs(range, degree = 2, knots = kn), data = lidar)
ps <- predict(ppmc, newdata = list(range = xx), se.fit = TRUE)
```
We now compute upper and lower confidence bands (I used 2 standard errors) around the fitted regression line:

```r
up <- (ps$fit + 2 * ps$se.fit)
lo <- (ps$fit - 2 * ps$se.fit)
```
Finally, we display the *confidence bands* we just constructed (using **base R** graphics, 
but also consider using `ggplot2`):


```r
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
lines(predict(ppmc)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 4, col = "gray30")
myrgb <- col2rgb("red") / 256 # , alpha=TRUE)
myrgb <- rgb(red = myrgb[1], green = myrgb[2], blue = myrgb[3], alpha = .3)
polygon(c(xx, rev(xx)), c(up, rev(lo)), density = NA, col = myrgb) #' lightblue')
lines(ps$fit ~ xx, data = lidar, lwd = 4, col = "blue")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/bsplines.se5-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**It is important to note that the above confidence bands were constructed assuming that the knots were fixed (not random), and similarly for the degree of the spline basis.** 

Increasing the degree of the cubic basis yields smoother fits (having higher order continuous derivatives). For example, using cubic splines yields an even smoother fit:


```r
# cubic splines
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
ppmc <- lm(logratio ~ bs(range, degree = 3, knots = kn), data = lidar)
lines(predict(ppmc)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "tomato3")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/bsplines3-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that the estimated regression function seems to have started to "twitch"
and wiggle, particularly at the upper end of our observations. 

## How many knots should we use?

So far we have used 5 knots, but we could have used any other number of knots. If we consider a quadratic
spline basis with 10 knots, the fit appears a bit better (at least aesthetically): 


```r
k <- 10
kn <- as.numeric(quantile(lidar$range, (1:k)/(k + 1)))
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
ppmc <- lm(logratio ~ bs(range, degree = 2, knots = kn), data = lidar)
lines(predict(ppmc)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "tomato3")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/bsplines.10knots-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

What about using more knots? The following plot used 50 knots:


```r
k <- 50
kn <- as.numeric(quantile(lidar$range, (1:k) / (k + 1)))
ppmc <- lm(logratio ~ bs(range, degree = 2, knots = kn), data = lidar)
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
lines(predict(ppmc)[order(range)] ~ sort(range), data = lidar, lwd = 6, col = "hotpink")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/bsplines.50knots-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Clearly not a good idea!

## Smoothing splines

If we were to follow the approach discussed so far we would need to 
find an "optimal" of selecting the number of knots and their
positions, **plus** the order of the spline basis. Although one
could consider using cross-validation for this, we note that 
this would require considerable computational effort (we would need 
to perform an exhaustive search on a 3-dimensional grid). 

We saw in class that *natural cubic splines* provide a natural
*optimal* 
space to look for a good regression estimator. For a formal
but surprisingly simple proof of this optimality result, 
see again Section 4.1 of

> Wood, S. (2006). *Generalized additive models : an introduction with R*.
> Chapman & Hall/CRC, 
> Boca Raton, FL. [Library link](http://resolve.library.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/catsearch?bid=8140311).

This result not only justifies using natural cubic splines, 
but also eliminates many of the unknown "tuning parameters" (the degree
of the spline basis, the number of knots, and their locations). 
In fact, we only need to select one tuning parameter--the penalty term, which 
can be done using any cross-validation "flavour" (although 
in this setting leave-one-out CV is particularly appealing, as
we discussed in class).


The function `smooth.spline` in `R` computes a cubic smoothing spline 
(natural cubic spline). Details on its arguments and different options
are available from its help page. 

When applied to the `lidar` data with penalization 
parameter equal to 0.2 (setting the argument `spar = 0.2`) 
we obtain the following estimated regression function:


```r
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
tmp <- smooth.spline(x = lidar$range, y = lidar$logratio, spar = 0.2, cv = FALSE,
    all.knots = TRUE)
lines(tmp$y ~ tmp$x, lwd = 6, col = "magenta")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/smoothing1-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This fit is clearly too wiggly and unsatisfactory. To obtain a smoother fit we increase the penalty term to 0.5:


```r
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
tmp <- smooth.spline(x = lidar$range, y = lidar$logratio, spar = 0.5, cv = FALSE,
    all.knots = TRUE)
lines(tmp$y ~ tmp$x, lwd = 6, col = "red")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/smoothing1.5-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The larger the penalty parameter, the smoother the fit. Setting it to 0.8 yields:


```r
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
tmp <- smooth.spline(x = lidar$range, y = lidar$logratio, spar = 0.8, cv = FALSE,
    all.knots = TRUE)
lines(tmp$y ~ tmp$x, lwd = 6, col = "blue")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/smoothing2-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

It is easy to see that the larger the penalty coefficient the closer
the resulting natural cubic spline becomes to a linear function (why?). 
For example, if we use `smooth.spline(spar=2)`:


```r
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
tmp <- smooth.spline(x = lidar$range, y = lidar$logratio, spar = 2, cv = FALSE, all.knots = TRUE)
lines(tmp$y ~ tmp$x, lwd = 6, col = "tomato3")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/smoothing3-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Selecting an "optimal" penalty parameter

As discussed in class, an "optimal" natural cubic spline can be found using 
cross-validation, and for these linear predictors, leave-one-out cross-validation
is particularly attractive (in terms of computational cost).
The function `smooth.spline` in `R` will compute (and use) an optimal value for the penalty term using 
leave-one-out cross-validation when we set the argument `cv = TRUE`: 


```r
tmp.cv <- smooth.spline(x = lidar$range, y = lidar$logratio, cv = TRUE, all.knots = TRUE)
# tmp.cv$spar = 0.974
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
lines(tmp.cv$y ~ tmp.cv$x, lwd = 6, col = "blue")
```

<img src="22-nonpar-splines-poly_files/figure-html/smoothing.cv1-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Sanity check (always a good idea)

Note that the optimal value found for the regularization parameter (`spar`) is
also returned in the element 
`$spar` of the object returned by `smooth.spline`. Just as a **sanity check**
we can now call `smooth.spline` with `cv = FALSE` and manually set
`spar` to this optimal value, and verify that we obtain the same fit:


```r
plot(logratio ~ range, data = lidar, pch = 19, col = "gray", cex = 1.5)
lines(tmp.cv$y ~ tmp.cv$x, lwd = 8, col = "blue")
tmp <- smooth.spline(x = lidar$range, y = lidar$logratio, spar = tmp.cv$spar, cv = FALSE,
    all.knots = TRUE)
lines(tmp$y ~ tmp$x, lwd = 3, col = "red")
```

## The problem of outliers and other model departures

When the data may contain outliers and/or other atypical observations,
the estimation methods discussed above may be seriously affected, even
if there are only a few such aberrant data points in the training set 
(possible outliers in the test / validation set are also a concern, but
we don't have time to discuss it here). Some robust estimation 
methods based on splines exist. See for example [@TharmaratnamClaeskens2010]
and references therein. Software in `R` implementing this method is available
[here](https://github.com/msalibian/PenalizedS).
