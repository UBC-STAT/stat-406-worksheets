This worksheet collection was originally created by [Prof. Salibi√°n-Barrera](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/matias-salibian-barrera) when he taught this course in 2019 and previous iterations. For the 2021 version, Prof. McDonald made some revisions and turned them into a book for use during labs and as a supplement to the course readings.
